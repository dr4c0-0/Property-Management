User Guide: Property Management System
Opening the Project
To begin, open the project in Delphi and ensure that all necessary database configurations are set up correctly.

Program Overview
The program starts with a home screen, where users can click to start. From there, they can log in using their username and password.

Username Creation: The username is generated by combining the userâ€™s name and surname (e.g., JohnSmith).
Password Example: A strong password format is required, such as kP3!rT9&yW.
Admins have a separate login process by selecting the Admin button and entering their name and email. New users can sign up if they do not already have an account.

Admin Portal
After logging in, admins are directed to the Admin page, which serves as the main management system. This section includes database operations utilizing SQL queries.

User Functions
Regular users are presented with a main menu, where they can choose between buying or selling properties.

Selling a Property: Users enter the property details, review their submission on a final form, and confirm the listing.
Buying a Property: A list of available properties is displayed, managed using arrays. Once a selection is made, users proceed to:
Choose a payment option
Set a payment period
Generate a receipt using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles via a class
Additional Features
Users can leave reviews after transactions.
A customer service request/reporting system is available in the main menu, where users can submit issues that are accessible to admins for resolution.
This program is designed in Delphi and follows structured database management practices to ensure efficiency and reliability.
